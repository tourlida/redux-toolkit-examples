## Extending our Project with RTK Query

In our ongoing efforts to explore the best practices and tools for state management, we're extending our current project to incorporate **RTK Query**. This addition will allow us to compare it directly with thunks and highlight the key differences and advantages that RTK Query brings to the table.

### RTK Query vs Thunks: A Comparative Overview

While our project has been using thunks for asynchronous operations, RTK Query offers a comprehensive toolkit designed specifically for data fetching and caching, providing several out-of-the-box features:

- **Automated Caching**: By caching results, RTK Query reduces the need for redundant network requests.
- **Automatic Refetching**: It keeps data fresh by re-fetching at specified intervals.
- **Polling**: An inbuilt mechanism to fetch data at regular intervals.
- **Optimistic Updates**: Provides a more responsive UI by predicting successful outcomes.
- **Automatic Retries**: In case of request failures, it can be set to try again automatically.
- **Mutation Invalidations**: After data changes, RTK Query can refresh specific cached entities.
- **Normalized Caching**: Data is stored in an efficient flat structure, reducing redundancy.
- **Query Lifecycle**: Offers granular control with lifecycle events.
- **DevTools Integration**: Enhanced debugging experience with the Redux DevTools.
- **Auto Slice Creation**: Minimizes boilerplate by auto-generating Redux slices.
- **Hooks Integration**: Includes React hooks for streamlined data interaction.

By integrating RTK Query alongside thunks, we aim to showcase the comparative strengths and capabilities of both, giving a clearer perspective on when and why to use one over the other.
